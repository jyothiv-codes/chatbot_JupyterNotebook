With GenAI at the crossroads of the future, it offers immense potential for women to use the benefits and capabilities of this technology to close the gender gap. I want to encourage all women to seize this opportunity. The flip side, of course, is that inaction will actually increase the gap.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s my call to action for women everywhere: dive into the AI wave, shape it, own it.

It shows that women in senior tech roles are not just pioneering the adoption of GenAI, but they are setting the pace, outperforming male counterparts in GenAI adoption by 14 percentage points.\\n \\nDespite these gains, we acknowledge the persisting obstacles women continue to face. Bridging this adoption gap is not just a tech issue; it\\'s a business priority that demands a concerted effort across all levels of an organization. \\n \\nThank you to my colleagues who drove this research: @Neveen Awad, @Maria Barisano, @Adriana Dahik, @Julie Bedard, @Uche Monu, and @Gunjan Mundhra.
